            <h4>Origins and Early Years</h4>
              <p>TechCon began in 1990 as a small gathering of technology enthusiasts and professionals 
                in Silicon Valley. Founded by Dr. Jane Smith and a team of industry pioneers, 
                the conference aimed to create a platform for sharing innovations and networking among 
                tech aficionados. The inaugural event was held in a modest hotel conference room and featured 
                just a handful of speakers and exhibitors.
